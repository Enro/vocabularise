First, make install ruby and a proper version of rubygems (>=1.7) on your system

    sudo apt-get install rubygems1.8

Then, install  headers packages required to build some gems

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev

Also install mandatory gem packages on your system

    sudo gem install bundle 
    sudo gem install capistrano capistrano-ext
    sudo gem install thin

And make sure that /var/lib/gems/1.8/bin is in your path. Update your ~.profile 
or ~/.bashrc or simply run

    export PATH=$PATH:/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/

Finally, from the project directory, run the following command to install
locally into the "vendor/" directory the gems required by this project and all
their dependencies :
